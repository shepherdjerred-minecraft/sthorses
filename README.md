## About
stHorses allows you to transport your horses by turning them into items. This lets you easily use them to get where you want to go, and them safely keep them with you until you need them again.

## Usage
Using stHorses is extremely simple! All you need is a horse with a saddle (or a llama with a carpet). Simply left-click the saddle while it's equipped to the horse, and the horse will be put stored in that saddle. To respawn the horse, just right-click while holding the saddle.

## Features

* This plugin is under 30KB, and won't harm your server's performance
